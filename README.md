# Comprehensive-Study-on-Anomaly-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Models



This study focuses on detecting anomalies in datasets using multiple machine learning algorithms. Anomalies, also known as outliers, are data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. Detecting anomalies is crucial in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, and industrial monitoring.


The study applies several anomaly detection techniques, including:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine)

LOF (Local Outlier Factor)

Isolation Forest

Objective

To compare the performance of different anomaly detection models.

To understand which models are more effective under different data conditions.

To provide a practical reference for applying unsupervised anomaly detection techniques.



Methodology

Data Preparation:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values (if any)

Feature scaling and normalization

Model Implementation:

DBSCAN: Clusters data points and identifies noise as anomalies.

One-Class SVM: Learns the boundary of normal data and flags points outside it as anomalies.

LOF: Measures local density deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors.

Isolation Forest: Detects anomalies by isolating observations using random splits.

Evaluation:

Visual inspection of anomalies using plots

Statistical analysis to compare detection results


Conclusion

This study demonstrates that anomaly detection can be approached using multiple models, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the right model depends on the nature of the dataset, dimensionality, and the type of anomalies expected.

Future Work

Apply ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models.

Test models on larger and more complex datasets.
